# ☣️ Pwndem1c

> _"You can't quarantine the pwn."_

**Pwndem1c** is a cyber outbreak of CTF players, infosec enthusiasts, and exploit artists. Born in the South, infected worldwide. We break things to learn, build things to teach, and spread CTF chaos wherever 1337 flags hide.

We're not just a team — we're a virus in the machine.

## 🧬 Who We Are

- 🎯 Focused on Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions — both offensive and defensive.
- 🌍 Started locally, expanding globally. Anyone willing to grind, learn, and teach is welcome.
- 🧠 Obsessed with reverse engineering, binary exploitation, crypto, web hacking, forensics, and all forms of digital chaos.
- 🛠️ Also build tools, resources, and maybe one day our own damn CTF.
